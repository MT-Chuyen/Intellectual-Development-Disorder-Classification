In this repository I perform a test to classify IDD and TDC labels.

The Machine leanring algorithm was reimplemented and achieved another conclusion like the sample paper

A deep learning algorithm is implemented to perform comparisons using automatic feature extraction. My current results are overfitting with the LTSM and CNN models. The RNN network has a weaker structure so it seems to give more feasible results, but my file above shows that it seems to be underfitting. But it is still ongoing to find the right model or techniques
